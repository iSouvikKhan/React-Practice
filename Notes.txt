Hot Reloading :
    Hot reloading allows you to see the changes that you have made in the code without reloading your entire app. Whenever you make any changes,
    all you need to do is save your code. As soon as you save your code, React Native tracks which files have changed since your last saved, and
    only reload those file for you.

useState :
    is such a function in react which accepts a value and returns 2 things in form of array
    here 2 things it returns,
        1. value, which you want to rerender
        2. the function which will take care of the value, through whom you get the rerendering part
--------------------------------
if(condition){
    useState() // not possible
}
--------------------------------
useState(){
    if(condition){

    }else{        // possible or allowed

    }
}
---------------------------------

useEffect : ( is auto callback )
    whenever rendering is happening useEffect is called
    it takes a callback function in its parameter
    and executes each time we render or rerender

useEffect 2nd parameter :
    if you provide the 2nd parameter, which is " [] " ( empty array ) then useEffect will work only once
    2nd time onwards, even if you rerender, useEffect will not work
    if the array is " [value] " in that case useEffect will be executed with each rerender
