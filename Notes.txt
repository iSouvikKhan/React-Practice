Context API :
    with this, 2 things come into picture, producer and consumer
    u need to wrap all the things inside the producer
    through consumer u will be using in the component, where it will be rendered
    to overcome the concept of PropDrilling, Context API is useful

    if the scenrio is very very complex the Redux can be used
